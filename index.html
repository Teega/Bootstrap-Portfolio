			  				Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Learn when to stop. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

							The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?
							</p>
							<p>
							Every time you practice, you learn more. Anyone can paint. This is your world.
							</p>
							<p>
							I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. We'll have a super time. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. You gotta think like a tree.
							</p>
							<p>
							Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. This is the fun part You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.
							</p>
							<p>
							Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here.
							</p>
							<p>
							We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.
